			            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			            <p>I study emergence of social inequality, how inequality influences human behaviors, and belief dynamics in society. The tools that I deploy include computational modeling, such as dynamical system and agent-based models, and observational data of the real-world.

			            I completed my Master's program in computer science at University of Souther California with a research project on utilizing machine learning with multimodal behavioral data to facilitate the annotation of utterances in psychotherapy sessions.</p>
